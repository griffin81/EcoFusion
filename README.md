# EcoFusion

## Abstract

EcoFusion is an innovative mobile application designed to bridge the gap between waste recycling and sustainable commerce. The app features an AI-powered waste detection system, built using TensorFlow, that helps users identify and classify different types of waste. This ensures proper recycling and repurposing, reducing environmental harm.
